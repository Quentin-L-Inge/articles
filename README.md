# articles

I tried a tool which do "Web Scraping". As a starting point we chose to focus on the results we can find on the Medium blog through this url : https://medium.com/search?q=pricing. 
In order to classify all those data we need to grab:

•	The ID of the articles
•	The authors
•	The descriptions
•	The publication dates
These informations will be written in a json document so that we can easily use it on a latter stage.
